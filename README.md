# Lilac
Auto-adjusting support cushion that corrects slouching, hunching, and unsupported sitting positions for improved posture.

89% of students experience sitting-induced back pain at least once each day and 41% of teens are actively seeking solutions to alleviate their back pain. Pressure sensors are placed throughout Lilac, which detect the user's pressure distribution and map the distribution to a posture preset. Based on the data from the sensors, air pumps adjust the height of the cushion to match the user's pressure distribution to an ideal distribution for optimal posture.

Lilac’s prototype uses force sensitive resistors and servo motors to adjust the cushion’s support when slouching, hunching, and unsupported sitting positions are detected. When slouching occurs, more pressure is put on the bottom of the back than the top, so the bottom servo motor moves up to alleviate stress on the lower spine. More pressure is put on the top part of the cushion when hunching occurs, so the top servo motor moves up to relieve stress in the middle and upper back along the neck. Muscle fatigue, tightness, and pain can also occur from straight but unsupported sitting positions. Lilac’s middle servo moves up for optimal posture support.

I prototyped Lilac with my team for the University of Pennsylvania's Management and Technology Summer Institute (M&TSI). Team members: Isabella He, Ashok Devireddy, Adrienne Park, Catherine Chu, Wilson Crum
